  <h2 class="mb-4 text-2xl font-medium md:text-4xl">Our story</h2>
  <p class="mb-4 xl:w-2/3">We were founded
    by 5 experienced technology professionals in 2017. The idea was to develop
    business-critical and user-oriented web-applications that have impact based
    on open data standards.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4 xl:w-2/3">
    What users want from data is insights. Insight is gained when knowledge
    interacts with knowledge: therefore, data should flow freely throughout
    systems, rather than being stored in ‘data silos’.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4 xl:w-2/3">
    That is why we prefer to work with semantically structured data models,
    which allow for data reusability, seamless integration, easy sharing, and
    automatic enrichment. In short, more insight, less waste.
  </p>
  <p class="xl:w-2/3">
    Since our founding, we have kept growing. Based in the heart of Brussels, we
    have an international outlook, and our coworkers come from all across
    Europe.

          <p>We consider ourselves an Open source company.
            Whenever possible we prefer to use Open Source, we contribute to
            open source projects, and we publish our work under open source
            licenses when we can.

            standards</h3>
          <p>We prefer not to publish data using
            proprietary standards, as we think this is often inefficient. By
            instead adopting open standards and semantics, we make our data more
            powerful and interoperable.</p>

  <h2 class="mb-4 text-2xl font-medium md:text-4xl">The web we want</h2>
  <p class="mb-4 xl:w-2/3">
    The web is one of the most important inventions of all time. It is important
    that it stays open and accessible to everybody. Today, the major tech
    companies and some governments are closing off parts of the web and making
    it difficult for smaller actors to compete in other areas. Many of them
    combine their immense power with a predatory approach to how they handle
    user data and privacy.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4 xl:w-2/3">
    They are creating a ‘web of walls’.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4 xl:w-2/3">
    The web should instead be an open and safe arena, a public good. As a
    company, we believe we can change the web by being careful in what
    technologies we use and what actors we cooperate with. By committing to open
    standards, Open Source and semantic technologies, and collaborating with
    like-minded actors we can help bring about the web we want.
