  <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-4xl mb-4 font-medium">Our story</h2>
  <p class="w-full md:w-2/3 text-gray-800 text-base md:text-lg">We were founded by 5 experienced technology professionals in 2017. The idea was to develop
    business-critical and user-oriented web-applications that have impact based on open data standards.

    <br><br>What users want from data is insights. Insight is gained when knowledge interacts with knowledge: therefore,
    data should flow freely throughout systems, rather than being stored in ‘data silos’.
    <br><br>
    That is why we prefer to work with semantically structured data models, which allow for data reusability, seamless
    integration, easy sharing, and automatic enrichment. In short, more insight, less waste.
    <br><br>
    Since our founding, we have kept growing. Based in the heart of Brussels, we have an international outlook, and our
    coworkers come from all across Europe.

  <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-4xl mb-4 font-medium">The web we want</h2>
  <p class="w-full md:w-2/3 text-gray-800 text-base md:text-lg">
    The web is one of the most important inventions of all time. It is important that it stays open and accessible to everybody.
    Today, the major tech companies and some governments are closing off parts of the web and making it difficult for smaller actors to compete in other areas. Many of them combine their immense power with a predatory approach to how they handle user data and privacy.
    <br><br>
    They are creating a ‘web of walls’.
    <br><br>
    The web should instead be an open and safe arena, a public good.
    As a company, we believe we can change the web by being careful in what technologies we use and what actors we cooperate with.
    By committing to open standards, Open Source and semantic technologies, and collaborating with like-minded actors we can help bring about the web we want.
