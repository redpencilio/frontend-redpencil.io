      <p class='mb-12 text-base leading-relaxed'>You are a full stack
        developer, eager to work on both frontend and backend technologies. You
        will develop applications for 80% of your time, and are free to improve
        tooling and experiment with new technologies that may provide business
        value with the other 20% of your time. You work on practical, reusable
        solutions that serve the clients' needs. Together we build applications
        using both existing and new components.</p>

        looking for?</h2>
      <p class='mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed'>Experience gets you
        a long way. An eager mind gets you everywhere. We expect you to know how
        to develop software applications. You should know how to solve puzzles
        and how to write code. A diploma shows a lot, so does Open source work
        and prior work experience. All are appreciated, at least one is
        required. Developing software is a balancing act.</p>
