      <h2 class="title-md">Job description</h2>
      <p>You are a full stack developer, eager to work on both frontend and backend technologies. You
        will develop applications for 80% of your time, and are free to improve tooling and experiment
        with new technologies that may provide business value with the other 20% of your time. You
        work on practical, reusable solutions that serve the clients' needs. Together we build
        applications using both existing and new components.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="mb-24">
      <h2 class="title-md">Who are we looking for?</h2>
      <p>Experience gets you a long way. An eager mind gets you everywhere.
        We expect you to know how to develop software applications. You should know how to solve
        puzzles and how to write code. A diploma shows a lot, so does Open Source work and prior work
        experience. All are appreciated, at least one is required.
        Developing software is a balancing act. We look for someone who:
        <ul>
          <li>&#8226; likes coding, likes solving the puzzles without losing sight of the bigger picture</li>
          <li>&#8226; likes to implement use cases and aims for reusable components</li>
          <li>&#8226; likes working with (linked) data</li>
          <li>&#8226; likes to learn new stuff and is not dogmatic about the technologies he/she likes to use</li>
        </ul>
        Speaking Dutch is a big plus, the majority of our customers and a big part of the business domain
        are in Flanders. For practical reasons you must be based in Belgium and have the belgian
        nationality or a european work permit.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="mb-24">
      <h2 class="title-md">What technologies do we use?</h2>
      <p>Our backend consists of reusable and understandable microservices, integrated by a single page
        app. You don’t need to know any of the following, but knowing some is appreciated. We will
        guide you and provide you with time to learn.
        Technologies we use daily are:
        <ul>
          <li>&#8226; JavaScript (frontend with EmberJS, backend with NodeJS), Ruby, Docker, SPARQL & Linked Data</li>
          <li>&#8226; Git, Linux (and a little bit of Mac), Emacs, Inkscape, the coffee corner</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>

        </ul>
        Other technologies we make use of:
        <ul>
          <li>&#8226; Elixir, Common Lisp, Python, Scala, Bash.</li>
          <li>&#8226; Git, Linux (and a little bit of Mac), Emacs, Inkscape, the coffee corner</li>
        </ul>

        Open Source examples on github are: lblod, mu-semtech, redpencilio, nvdk, cecemel, erikap,
        madnificent.</p>

    <article class="mb-24">
      <h2 class="title-md">What do we offer?</h2>

        <li>&#8226; A fair, honest and open employer.</li>
        <li>&#8226; 20% time to learn or to grow a project we both believe in. </li>
        <li>&#8226; A senior team you can learn from, and will learn from you. </li>
