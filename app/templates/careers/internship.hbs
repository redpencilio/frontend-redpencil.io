      <h2 class='mb-2 text-2xl text-zinc-950 font-medium md:mb-6'>What is ‘a better
        web’?</h2>
      <p class='mb-12 text-base leading-relaxed'>The web is one of
        the most important inventions of all time. It is important that it stays
        open and accessible to everybody. Today, the major tech companies and
        some governments are closing off parts of the web and making it
        difficult for smaller actors to compete in other areas. Many of them
        combine their immense power with a predatory approach to how they handle
        user data and privacy.
        <br /><br />
        They are creating a ‘web of walls’.
        <br /><br />
        The web should instead be an open and safe arena, a public good. As a
        company, we believe we can change the web by being careful in what
        technologies we use and what actors we cooperate with. By committing to
        open standards, Open Source and semantic technologies, and collaborating
        with like-minded actors we can help bring about the web we want.
        <br /><br />
        We can not do this without young, inspired thinkers like you.
