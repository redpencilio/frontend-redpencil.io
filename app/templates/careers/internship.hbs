      <p>Experience gets you a long way. An eager mind gets you everywhere.
        We expect you to know how to develop software applications. You should know how to solve
        puzzles and how to write code. A diploma shows a lot, so does Open Source work and prior work
        experience. All are appreciated, at least one is required.

          <li>&#8226; likes working with (linked) data</li>
          <li>&#8226; likes to learn new stuff and is not dogmatic about the technologies he/she likes to use</li>
        </ul>

        Speaking Dutch is a big plus, the majority of our customers and a big part of the business domain
        are in Flanders. For practical reasons you must be based in Belgium and have the belgian
        nationality or a european work permit.</p>
