      <h2 class="title-md margin-bottom-xsmall">What is ‘a better web’?</h2>
      <p>The web is one of the most important inventions of all time. It is important that it stays open and accessible to everybody.
Today, the major tech companies and some governments are closing off parts of the web and making it difficult for smaller actors to compete in other areas. Many of them combine their immense power with a predatory approach to how they handle user data and privacy.
<br><br>
They are creating a ‘web of walls’.
<br><br>
The web should instead be an open and safe arena, a public good.
As a company, we believe we can change the web by being careful in what technologies we use and what actors we cooperate with.
By committing to open standards, Open Source and semantic technologies, and collaborating with like-minded actors we can help bring about the web we want.
<br><br>
We can not do this without young, inspired thinkers like you.
