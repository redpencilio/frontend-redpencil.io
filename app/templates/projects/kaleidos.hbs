      We choose to do this not because it is easy
    </h2>
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
      The program involves aligning objectives and the redesign of processes with the services of the Chancellery
      <span class="text-sm">(legal, secretary, communications, publications, finance)</span>
      , central user and authorisation management of the
      Flemish Government, central IT services for website and mail, 9 different political cabinets, 9 government
      departments, the Flemish Parliament and several other institutions.

      <br><br>
      Every minor or major upgrade must be deployed
      in such a way that the governmental work can proceed without interruption. In every step strong controls are
      required, but equally there must be an option for flexibility to bend for specific edge cases. And all functions
      need to be intuitive.

      <br><br>
      The Kaleidos project was the driver to add a number of major modules to the semantic.works stack: rolling data
      driven authorisation, model driven full text search, HTTP-monitoring between the micro services, redundancy setup.
      Redpencil is proud to contribute to facilitating and supporting the decision making and the transparency of the
      democratic decision process with open-source software activating linked data.

    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
      In the slipstream of the application for the actual management of the agenda and files, we also developed an
      application for disseminating the files of the intergovernmental Overleg Comit√© and we developed the platform
      which makes the public available information about the formation of the governments and the decisions available as
      open data.
